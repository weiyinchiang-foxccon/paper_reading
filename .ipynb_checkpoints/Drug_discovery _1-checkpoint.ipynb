    "According to the claim by the author, this paper is **the first paper that deals with the real-world learning task via quantum GAN**. The real-world task here means the help for drug selection. The drug design is normally a long process, all kinds of combinations are the candidates of the possible new drugs. However, this can take a long time to perform the experiments in wet-lab to eliminate those unwanted candidates. Thanks for the artificial intelligence and powerful computer, the candidates can be preselected by a neural network, which trained by the chemical database, encoding the experience of what feasible drug suppose to look like."
